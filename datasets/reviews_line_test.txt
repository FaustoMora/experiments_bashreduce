Pepe is a great. fully open minded person who helped me everything. He always took care of me if I needed something. So I could feel free to ask him everything; how to get a place I wanted to go. if there's a good coach for my surfing etc. and he did his best immediately. The room was also wonderful. I could see beautiful sunset & sunrise everyday with laying down the bed. It needed about 10mins walk to the beach and restaurant area..We read so many great reviews of Pepe's place and arrived with very high expectations. All of which were surpassed. Pepe is a superb host with a beautiful property full of intrigue. We loved it. Thanks Pepe!.We had a great experience at Casa Kei - the house is absolutely beautiful in a jungle-like setting with hammocks. fruit trees. animals. etc. The common areas and the rooms are very clean and it was a great place to relax after an adventurous week. We stayed in the top-floor room and the views of the ocean and sunset were amazing! Very romantic!! Pepe is a great host - very warm and welcoming and made our stay comfortable and incredible! Definitely go to the restaurant Pepe recommends in Punta Zicatela - it was great! We loved the cute green parrot Guacamole! Thanks. Pepe. we hope to come back soon!.Hospedarme en Casa Kei ha sido una experiencia fabulosa. aun cuando yo he viajado muchas ocasiones a Puerto Escondido. esta vez conocí gente increíble.

Pepe is very relaxed and friendly guy that make you feel at home. Every morning we had a cup of very nice coffee and at the afternoon fresh fruit water. Pepe was always helpful and with time for explain things to the guests. It seems that he actually enjoy having people around at his place. The room was simple but great. like a three house. fresh with the breeze from the sea. I would really recommend to my friends to crash with him when in Puerto Escondido or Zicatela..Pepe is a great host and Anfitrión! He was waiting outside for my arrival and is one of the most present hosts I have seen. Great place to call home for a couple days!.Everything was so perfect. the view is amazing and the room too ! Pepe is nice. helpfull and so much more. What for an amazing host ! thank you for everything pepe !.The house was great just as described. Pepe was really welcoming and helpful. Super chill place. It has several rooms so we got to meet two other guests which was fun. The beach is a close walk. not too much going around the place but cabs are easy access. We got at least 3 cabs that knew the name of house just by directing them to the school that's across the street. The room itself is very small. it's just the bed (but that's all you really need) I've personally never used a mosquito net to sleep so for me it was an experience. Only thing I was uncomfortable with was the cat that comes up at night which literally did everything possible to come under the net and sleep on top. The view in the morning is priceless though. Pepe also gave us a taste of the best mescal we tasted throughout our whole trip..Casa Kei was amazing!!! The whole place was beautiful and magical! You can feel the positive energy as soon as you open the gate. which i think is more important than anything. Everywhere you look there is cool art and helpful advice for getting around puerto Escondido. I felt right at home there and will definitely be staying there anytime I am traveling through the area again. Thank you Pepe and Heidi for making my stay in Puerto 100x better!!!.Un endroit de reve...merci a Pepe pour sa patience et ses informations ....merci a Heidi pour sa gentillesse et son accueil...nous avions la " chambre" du dernier etage . autant dire un bungalow suspendu au dessus des cocotiers . la brise du pacifique et le chant des coqs du matin pour un reveil de bonne humeur...tout y est . on a aimé ! Lieu convivial et chaleureux . propre et bien entretenu.le centre ville de Puerto Escondido est simple d acces ( colectivo au coin de la rue ).lieu ideal pour les surfers ( grosses vagues )..Casa Kei was brilliant! The room had an incredible view. and a really lovely breeze to keep it cool. The location is excellent - a 5 minute walk to the village at La Punta and 150 metres from a great little fruit and veg shop. and lady selling delicious homemade icecream! The shared kitchen is a plus too. Pepe and Heidi were fantastic hosts - it was all really easy to organise. I'd highly recommend a few nights at Casa Kei..Casa Kei is such a perfect spot- like staying in a tree house in the jungle. Handy little shop around the corner selling fresh veg / home made chorizo / cheese / tortillas. and la Punta just down the road for mellow surfing. Zicatella is a short walk down the beach or a 5 minute collectivo. Casa Kei is small enough so you get to know the other people staying well- a peaceful but social little spot. Thanks for having us Pepe!.Pepe was very welcoming and a great host. The third story view was great and you could feel a very pleasant breeze throughout the day. This hostel is a great place to relax. read. and surf la Punta and beyond..Pepe es un amor. The pictures he has don't do justice to the beauty of his place. I stayed in the top room and the view was breathtaking. Waking up to that view is unforgettable. Pepe made sure my concerns were met. It does get pretty hot so sun dresses were probably the coolest choice. Transportation with collectivos super cheap $7 MX pesos to get you to most places. Carrizalillo beach is a beauty. While you swim you look back and it's a jungle in the background. Perfect for a honeymoon or a couples getaway. Oh and Pepe is very flexible about increasing your stay he will accommodate you if you chose to stay longer. Beautiful beautiful place. Make sure you try the mole at the mercado..Casa Kei is a beautiful place. a lot of preparation has gone into the design of the place. The top cabana has an amazing view. so nice to sleep and rise to the natural light and you get a nice breeze up there that the lower cabanas don't seem to get as much. This came in handy as it was pretty humid while we were there. Only thing to mention is that the top cabana is a tad on the small side for two people but the trade-off is an amazing view! there's plenty of other places within Casa Kei to store your stuff if you need so it's no biggie. Good location. about a 10-15 min walk to the beach and about 2-3mins to a collectivo pickup point which will take you into the Puerto town centre for a mere 7 pesos each way. Pepe was a great host. super chill and very good with communication. He made coffee every morning for all the guests. gave us loads of recommendations about the area and super helpful if we had any requests. Great stay!.A cool little spot at the zicatela end (the best part!) of Puerto Escondido. We didn't have the pleasure of meeting Pepe in the flesh but he had a couple of friendly volunteers taking care of things whilst he was away. The top room was a great place to catch a breeze and chill in the hammock for an afternoon. Plus 2 cute cats to keep you company. Would stay here again for sure!.Pepe's place is so wonderful. It is a private Oasis. My bf and I stayed at the top of the place where you have this incredible view as described. Pepe takes so much pride on his place. You can see him all day working to make all the guest comfortable. Cleaning. picking up. refilling supplies. He thinks about every little detail you can imagine. You wont mind spending the day in that place . because it is not like getting bored at a hotel. You can read. watch the sunset. talk to other guest. I think what I liked the most. was the cleanness of the place. I saw him changing sheets once a guest left. the bathroom. some are private and some are share. but he makes sure the share bathrooms are always clean and smell good. He is a master on what he does as a host. He is warm and welcoming and I would definitely come back again. You get more than what you give for your money. Thank you Pepe we loved Casa Kei!.Pepe è stato un host molto accogliente e ci ha aiutato ad orientarci nel paesino. Se vi piace la vita comunitaria. avete un budget limitato e vi piace chiaccherare con persone di diverse nazionalità questo è un ottimo posto dove allogiare..Wonderfull Place to stay!!! Perfectly clean and comfortable. Location is great in a quiet area of town but close to some Restaurants. Bars and beach. Pepe is a friendly and helpfull host giving Loads of good advices. We would always come back if we are around!.Pepe's place is wonderful! It's a bargain and you'll have a great experience! He was so welcoming when we arrived and continued to be really generous. easygoing and helpful. This room has an incredible view of the ocean and it was an awesome experience to sleep with no walls. The mosquito net was big and worked perfectly. It felt very safe and homely. Pepe even got up super early to call us a taxi to the airport. Nice kitchen. bathrooms and art too. P.s The beach and roads get super hot in the day so take flipflops!.We loved Casa Kei so much that we extended our stay! This is a great intro to the tropical life at Puerto Escondido. Your little bungalow is equipped with palm leaf roofs. mosquito nets. beautiful painted murals. and pretty tiles everywhere. The kitchen is outdoors but equipped with the essentials. The garden is gorgeous and has fresh mangos. limes. and green papayas. There are two friendly cats and a little bird named Guacamole. The wifi can be spotty so bring a book for the hot mid-day sun and the Mosquitos can be relentless so bring repellent! The outdoor shower is super refreshing after a hot walk around the neighborhood. Pepe is very helpful and gives great local advice. The location is perfect for either walking to La Punta for world-famous surfing or catching a colectivo (bus) to town..It does have a great view!.Great place and great view if you stay at the roof top room! Pepe is very cool and friendly. Location is great too. we recommend to relax and to live at the tropical rhythm!.Pepe is kind. generous. and very knowledgeable about the area. There are lots of great. small places to eat in the neighborhood. The view from the cabaña is beautiful. and it´s great for laying in the hammock with the breeze coming through on a hot Puerto afternoon. Casa Kei is nice. and the atmosphere is friendly. I would definitely rent there again. P.S. The free coffee in the morning is huge! Especially considering that most other places in Oaxaca make very weak coffee compared to what I´m used to..Unfortunately the host was not there when I arrived. Room was nice and was definitely the best in the place (the top room).Wonderful. The top room is great. I've never woke up to a better view..Staying at Casa Kei was an amazing experience and the perfect introduction to my time in La Punta. The Cabana room is awesome. it has great views and is the perfect breezy spot for afternoon naps. Pepe was super friendly and helpful. and encouraged a really nice social environment for meeting other guests. Highly recommend Casa Kei and particularly the Cabana room..Nick and I stayed at Casa Kei main cabana with the sunset view and we would both agree that our time there helped shape our amazing experience in puerto! Along with all the other guests. Pepe was truly amazing!!! Always asking if all was okay and making our stay very very pleasant. We would 100% recommend anyone who is looking to relax and enjoy the view to stay here. Very excited to return to Puerto in the future and stay at Casa Kei!!!! Many thanks to Pepe and his great team *ahem Aimee and Samantha*...our time here would have never been the same without you!! Brittany & Nick.Accueil très sympathique par Pépé. Le coucher de soleil vu de la cabane est effectivement magnifique ! Nous avons apprécié notre séjour à Casa Kei..Pepe was a great host and welcomed us very friendly. He also gave us helpful advise about where to go in Punta Zicatela/Puerto Escondido. The view from the room is spectacular and falling asleep to the sound of waves was amazing. We also really liked the murals and the little garden..Really neat experience being in an open room on the third floor of a cabana overlooking the ocean. Beautiful sunsets are in perfect room from the hammock in the room. And get ready to wake up to the sounds of dogs and roosters ;) everyone at Casa Kei was very kind and helpful. very clean place with nice areas to lounge around and hang out. The beach and Zicatela town is just a five minute walk away. quiet beach town (at least this time of year). good restaurants. fish tacos. and margaritas!.The room at the top of the stairs is awesome - like a thatch roofed clubhouse. Pink dawn views from bed and violet tangerine sunsets. It's cozy an comfy. your own private beach shack. The rest of the house is great too. Tidy bathroom. outdoor kitchen. dining room table for eating an cards. 5 min walk to la punta beach. It's off the main tourist strip at zicatela. but that's a good thing. Hit me up if you want to know the BEST fish taco place in town. Will stay here again..We are very grateful to Pepe. who accommodated us when we booked at the last minute. He was far away in Japan but quickly arranged for us to stay at his family home (the cabana room at casa mei was double booked). We were right by the beach and so comfortable. His friends Claudia and melo were great hosts. and thank you to Adam and Brittany from casa lei who helped us out. Thank you so much. Pepe. We can't wait for our next trip to pe!!.Loved Pepe's place up in the jungle! It felt like some real Mexican living. The outdoor kitchen was great for grilling and we cooked up several feasts. The 3rd floor Cabana was a cool spot to sleep after a hot hot day. The garden is a great place to hang out and play cards or chill in the hammocks. Pepe was super accommodating for us and we had a great place to park our motorbike. It was a fun week at Casa Kei for sure!.our experience in Puerto Escondido at Casa Kei was nothing short of excellent. The ambiance at the hostel is sweet and friendly and the free coffee great. The lack of Wi-Fi we realized was a plus as real conversation replaced nerdiness. Maria and I can wholeheartedly recommend Casa Kei and suggest you go for this rustic economical experience with an open heart and mind.My wife and I had a great stay at Casa Kei and met some lovely other people from around the world. Unfortunately. we did not meet Pepe as he was out of town during our stay. however it was very easy to communicate and organise our stay. Plus the free coffee in the morning was super good..Pepe and his cabana were a tropical dream come true! He was very easy to communicate with while making our reservatio and responded promptly to the questions we had. He was a gracious host and took time to tell us where the good spots to eat where and his favorite beaches. His garden was beautiful and we enjoyed cooking for ourselves and lounging in the hammock! The Mosquitos are rampant and he provides a net. but we would definitely recommend but spray if you're staying in the open cabaña. Overall. blissful trip. relaxed local atmosphere and beautiful spot. Gracias Pepe!.Though I was unable to stay with Pepe. he was easy to work with and refunded my money promptly..I had a pleasant stay at Pepes basic place. The view is great and the atmosphere is lovely.
